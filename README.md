# Vue generate
A CLI for generating component- and module templates in Vue.js.
Written in Node

## Compiling application to an executable
```
$ npm i -g pkg  
$ pkg vg.js
```

## Installing the app
1. change the name of the executable generated by pkg, into "vg", for Vue generate
2. move executable into a directory of your choice from which you globally can execute files
3. Ready to use!

## Generating a Vue 
```
$ vg component \<name>
```

If an **src/components** directory exists, the component will be created there.  
If not, it will be created in the directory where the command is executed.

#### Component flags
| Flag name      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| -d   | Adds a data property to the component        |
| -m   | Adds a methods property to the component        |
| --help   | Displays all options to the console        |

#### Example
$ vg component Button -d -m  
Generates a file called Button.vue  
which contains a vue component with data- and methods properties.

## Generating a Vuex module
```
$ vg vuexmod \<modulename>
```

If an **src/store** directory exists, the module will be created there.  
If not, it will be created in the directory where the command is executed.

#### Example
```
$ vg vuexmod SessionModule  
SessionModule was created in Vuex-store
```
